If you're poisoned, you cannot heal. This was a change made to the poison debuff in the most recent update to the game, which made certain enemies disproportionately more dangerous than before. But this change itself is still interesting and makes poison as a debuff less inconsequential, so the player simply needs a few more ways of countering poison than just Purity and Slime/Watcher Form. This mod serves to make poison a little more forgiving with the following changes.

- Stone Shield now gives 100% poison resistance on top of its other resistances.

- If you become immune to poison damage while poisoned, via Stone Shield or a spell, poison will automatically be removed at the end of your turn.

- Healing potions can now be used while poisoned. If you do so, it will remove poison but not heal you. This lets you recover by drinking an extra healing potion, as long as you don't get poisoned again before your next turn.

Do note, however, that this does not help with your minions getting poisoned. For that, I recommend my Missing Synergies and Underused Options mods, which has a few methods of removing debuffs from minions (Healing Light, Chaos Concoction, Prism Shell).
